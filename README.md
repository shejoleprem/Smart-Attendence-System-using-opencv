# Smart-Attendence-System-using-opencv
in this project we use opencv library to access the webcam of laptop to scan the face of user. we stored multiple users faces into the database and 
while taking the attendence the face of user compre with stored faces in the database using face recognition library in python library. if the face 
of user and stored image matches then attendence will be stored into the excel file. if user is not registered the user will get option registration for system.
we use email libraries to send stored attendence to the respective faculty.
